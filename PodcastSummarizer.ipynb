              "\"hello welcome back to the podcast all right how are you doing I hope you're doing fine in podcast land in lepland I hope you're having a nice morning afternoon evening night whatever time of day it is wherever you are hello welcome Kate Billington is back on the podcast again in this episode uh Kate is a popular guest this is her fourth appearance on the show just in case you don't know or in case you've forgotten Kate is an English teacher like me we work together in the same school she also does stand-up comedy in the evenings sometimes like me Kate also makes cakes she's a professionally qualified cake maker she makes Cakes and Pastries and Kate loves cycling and in fact this episode is called Kate Billington cycled to Berlin so here is about two hours of Kate and me in conversation natural conversation conversation that flows this way and that way as it moves forward so yeah two hours it's another long episode and so with this I just invite you to join us try to follow the conversation see what bits of English you can pick up along the way you don't have to listen to the whole thing in one go obviously you can if you want to just join us for the whole two hours but you don't have to listen to it all in one go you can listen to some and then stop and then later you can listen to some more uh the you know the more you listen the more you learn but it's up to you if you feel like after half an hour that's enough for you if you feel like you wanted a half an hour episode listen to half an hour of this but otherwise if you're enjoying it and you you are captivated keep going because the more you listen the more you learn hopefully um we will keep this fairly entertaining and enjoyable for you all the way through with some jokes some little stories and some little explanations of vocabulary or expressions or little cultural details um consider listening to the audio version on your phone you know what a phone is right consider listening to the audio version which you can just get in a podcast app on your phone I use pocket casts but you could use apple podcasts Google podcast Spotify you could listen to the audio version just subscribe to Luke's English podcast in your podcast app of choice and the advantage of that is that you can do other things while you listen just put your headphones on and uh you just do other things while you're listening which allows you to multitask like you could do some housework you could drive you could walk around somewhere just walk around in a circle uh or or alternatively walk to a specific place if you've got some shopping to do or something uh while you're spending time on public transport on the way to work and on the way back or whatever it is you're doing this is how most people listen to podcasts they just listen to the audio version allowing which allows you to do other things at the same time that's another way to do it alternatively you could just close your eyes and just focus on the words phrases and sentences that you can hear but don't do that while driving a car or operating heavy machinery or any of those other dangerous things um but there you go anytime you want to stop you can just pause the episode and all podcast apps will remember where you paused so that when you come back to the episode you'll be able to continue from that moment and then carry on and ultimately I think it's probably best not to think about the length of the episode okay don't see this as a mountain that you have to climb the length it doesn't really matter just join us get involved in our conversation keep listening enjoy it and get carried away by the sounds of the English language in Motion One Last Thing Before we start properly this episode is called Kate Billington cycled to Berlin and that was the original plan for this episode to talk about her long cycling adventure to Berlin cycling all the way to the to that City but in the typical way here on Luke's English podcast there were plenty of tangents distractions and other talking points along the way to that main topic and you'll see me trying to get there but for some reason we end up talking about this that and the other which is fine that's the whole Spirit of this show um so we do eventually talk about Kate's cycling trip and there's also a story about a nice a nice no that's not the word definitely not the right word not nice nasty there's a story of a very nasty cycling accident that Kate had recently which will definitely hold your attention so we do talk about those things about the cycling but it takes us a while to get there uh when do we when exactly do we start talking about the cycling trip and the cycling accident well you'll have to wait and see but keep listening because we do get there eventually so now without any further Ado let's now join my conversation with Kate and we jump straight in with me attempting to start the recording of the video and audio tracks while also making tea and talking to Kate all at the same time it's exactly the same way that uh the last episode with Kate started uh so more of the same kind of stuff more conversation with Kate all right good so now I've said that let's get started right now and here we go click record here so I have started and so my my decision there to start was based on oh God it's difficult to explain why well because okay maybe I shouldn't have started now I should have just finished the T and then started but uh I just kind of think I'll just press record and then I don't have to worry that's done and then we can just carry on and that's you know living with regrets now I know yeah now we can say Shoulda Woulda Coulda yeah should we teach your students that expression go ahead Shoulda Woulda could as a song isn't it is it Macy Gray could be I don't know don't know that you don't know that that's all no I don't think so I'm not going to sing it because it's embarrassing for everything you use this in an English lesson by any chance I have I've used it for pronunciation because it means um should have and would have and could have so it's like it's about somebody regretting their like I think it's about how regretting losing a partner or something like that breaking up with somebody yeah and the song says the song says all the things that she should have done and could have done and would have done if she could go back and change it but the song isn't called should have would have thank you could have it's sure it's called Shoulda Woulda Coulda yeah because that's how we actually say it yeah should have done this I should have I should have put the milk in you know before I started press before I pressed record I should have done that I should have done this isn't that I should have given Kate the tea earlier when I invited her onto the podcast last time yeah I calculated it regret it was over 30 minutes that you had to wait I think that's the first time in my life I've ever been 30 minutes without tea really it's always like at least maximum tea drinker yeah yeah so you have to there's no no more than 30 minutes between each cup yeah okay and I I would have refused to come back except that you said lots of people listen to the episode yeah yeah yeah so see that was I was just trying to find an excuse to use wooder right that's why I said that sentence you know what I think it's would have I think basically is American isn't she yeah she is yeah so was I would have I would have refused but was American what she changed her nationality or she died I think she might have died the point we're trying to make for people who are actually here to listen to their English and not find out whether or not Macy Gray is still alive um is that Americans would often say shoulder yeah and Bricks would often say should have yeah but nobody would say in the context of a normal sentence should have with like the strong pronunciation of have unless they're unless they're emphasizing it for a certain reason but I don't know what that reason would be it's an auxiliary maybe if if you say uh I should have gone to the doctor and they say you can't go to the doctor now and you go no no I should have gone to the doctor yes so but then you would probably also emphasize the gone I should have gone you'd probably still but you'd say they have your right you'd say that should I should have gone to the doctor but you can still there's still time I should have gone yes I suppose you would uh yeah she's still alive yeah all right Macy Gray um how old is she she's not even that old is she Natalie Renee McIntyre known by her stage name Macy Gray is an American r b soul and soul singer and actress she's known for her distinctive raspy voice and a singing style heavily influenced by Billie Holiday uh gray has released 10 Studio albums and received five Grammy Award nominations winning one and she's still very much alive I don't know why you thought that she'd passed away I don't know just now that Tina Turner has got nasty and they've all gone all singers also all r b songs all great r b soul singers have gone here first yeah um Tina Turner that's yeah pity lost another Legend I heard about that in class one of my students said it really and I had to like lean on the table and I was like I'm sorry guys I'm gonna need to take a minute yeah because I was very shocked same thing happened and they all knew they all knew that you were shocks they all knew that she had died and I was the last one really so they got to enjoy you receiving the news they found it quite funny it was to be fair it was quite funny that you received the news and you were shocked yes not that she died no that's just sad yeah it's quite sad but it's not a tragedy is it she was 83. yeah she lived she led a good life she had a good Innings I taught them that expression yeah yeah only use that in Britain they don't say that in the states then or Australia or oh okay so in in cricket playing countries maybe yeah yeah I guess but so yes maybe they would say in Australia India South Africa I don't know shall we explain she had a good Innings I mean this is since this is a learning english podcast yeah I'm also I'm not supposed to be like rainbow I just noticed my hair is a bit weird someone's gonna fix that go ahead so we're on video obviously uh audio listeners there's a video camera filming us which is you know an interesting experience we talked about that last time this is what happens when you come onto my podcast we just talk about the same thing we talked about in the previous episode we do which is probably the thing we talked about in the previous episodes of that somehow just go over the same ground every single time um but yeah so she had a good Innings right Tina Turner so Innings so I think if you wanted to use a more International expression you'd say she lived to a good age you say it was 83 is a good age yeah and that's I think that would be quite Universal as an expression yeah but a good Innings is it refers to Cricket and it refers to a qriket score so when you're batting the goal is to get as many round as many runs as possible yeah and not not there are no goals involved sorry sorry the goal the objective the objective is to get as many as many runs as possible and that's and your Innings is the amount of time that you're batting yeah you can stay in for you can stay in for ages you can stay back until someone balls you out you could be in all day or you could be in for several days you could be in for several days which would include multiple tea breaks yeah because that's not even a joke because this is a British sport it's great isn't it I love Cricket so much I miss Cricket I actually have a cricket ball uh here you do um which is just like a it's just a really good sort of stress reliever all right okay it's um just yes Cricket balls are wonderful things they're they're covered in leather and they've got these um stitching stitching the seam down the middle which is actually an important part of the game because you can if you're bowling the ball you have to bounce the ball and you can throw it so that it bounces on the seam and that makes it unpredictable is it going to go this way that way uh and other things but uh so yeah seeing Cricket um if you are batting if you are hitting the ball you can stay there all day if no one gets you out and if you do have a a long Innings um and you stay there for a long time and you get a good score then yeah you would say oh he had a good Innings oh she or she yes were she to be a female cricketer yeah or they well we did not know yeah exactly if it's if they're at a distance or it just wasn't uh clear or yeah or for some any other reason but um um so Tina Turner yeah we do say that about someone who's lived a good long life and it's a sort of a positive thing to say when someone has died yeah they've had a good long life you can say well you know he had a good inning she had a good Innings yeah yeah I think we say I I say quite a lot if somebody's yeah somebody's died at it an age that suggests the lived a good life or lived a plentiful life absolutely yeah she had a good Innings I was still a bit upset when she died and I still had to lean on the table similar thing happened to me when David Bowie died that one hurt didn't it yeah it did because it was unexpected and he just released an album and he was kind of like you know backing our thoughts and stuff like that like a week before I saw the video for for the his latest single and it was strange and uh it was weird and it Disturbed me and then the video the video did yeah Lazarus I think it was or dark star or something like that there's it was very odd lots of sort of uh what looked like a cult imagery and references to his uh his career and and weird things I didn't know what to make of it I watched it early in the morning the next week I was just about to go into an English lesson and one of our colleagues um Rob do you remember do I remember Rob do you remember not not the Rob that was there now Dylan do you remember Dylan also still there now no he's not there no there's no it was another Dylan we had another Dylan yeah there's another Dylan yeah Dylan uh Walker I think if there'd been two Dylan's I would have been maybe he left maybe he left before you kind of got a chance to meet him he does a does a podcast as well now called English with Rob even though his name is Dylan but uh yeah Dylan is his middle name or I don't know it's confusing but um yeah anyway so he came into the teacher's room it was like maybe 10 minutes before I was due to go into class and start teaching he came into the teacher's room he's like David Bowie just died and I was like what what yeah you know um and then I had to go in and teach and I was like okay uh oh so today's lesson is about David Bowie died and one of my other students was a huge David Bowie fan and she was like yeah I know oh no [Music] yeah so the whole lesson we were both like this yeah he was Ill so that's was that why his last album was about what his career had been and yeah yeah lots of sort of deep hidden meanings and a lot of a lot of stuff like that yeah the video's gone off the the camera the computer's gone into when the computer went to sleep but we are still uh being filmed the video is still rolling all right okay all right so okay wow we've already covered quite a lot of ground there yes yeah we have yeah yeah so you uh you have actually have a plan for the podcast I have a plan yeah oh yeah I did write some notes we're going to talk about last like the last appearance yeah uh that's not part of the plan no I thought that we would start by well let's see so I saw you uh recently or you you texted me and he said can I come back on the podcast I said of course you can um and you said because I want to talk about uh cycling to Berlin yeah I did want to talk about that and then after I'd said it I was like I've not really got many stories about it really because when you cycle somewhere a lot of the time you're just on your own on a bicycle yeah it's not really anecdote Rich unless it's a tandem well then you'd be on your own on a tandem yeah you're not necessarily going to have another person on it are you no I I like to cycle alone because um because other people are quite annoying and I'm also quite annoying especially on Long holidays really yeah why what happens I just so cycling is quite stressful sometimes because obviously you've got to get you've got to get to the place you want to get to by the end of the day and if you have things like punctures or if you get lost or anything like that then it's quite you can get quite stressed and then I get very angry and I shout at my bicycle or I shout at my phone or my GPS if I go wrong yeah and it's just what kind of what kind of things do you shout can you say um you could swear or you could I don't want to swear no okay it's very polite fair enough fair enough yeah some there are times when swearing is appropriate and one of those times is when you're cycling and you're trying to get to a certain place and you're climbing up a hill or something like that and things are difficult and you're you have frustration and you vent it against you vent it at an inanimate object which I think is fine because the inanimate object can take it and I do always say sorry as well afterwards I always feel bad and then I always think if it's maybe it's not as inanimate as I think it is and maybe it's gonna be angry with me and stop working yeah you never know especially you never know especially with your phone because they're that close to to being sentient now aren't they yeah yeah you've got to be careful what you say to your phone I mean I've got very old phone so I think it's quite far from being expensive yeah but I I um I don't really apologize to my phone I don't I don't like my phone so yeah where is it it's in it's in my bike helmet it's probably here it's just there just yeah your phone's just feeling sad I don't like phones in general you know no because they're just I don't like the fact that you kind of we don't have to have one but I feel like I have to have one yeah you know no I know completely um yeah I mean they're obviously very useful but also we have to have them now don't we yeah we've been forced to kind of do that now uh but yeah they're often I am much happier when I take steps to put the phone away I keep it in my bag and I'm like right I will not check it because you know we're being psychologically manipulated and we just uh have to we just pick it up without even realizing it like the decisions been made for us yeah but you will now pick up your phone you haven't picked up your phone for for however many minutes um yeah you know so yeah um I'm gonna check my you know it hasn't gone off because no one texts me or calls me ever but I'll check it just in case yeah why there was you know you know Sandy talksfig yes the comedian comedian yes is brilliant in my opinion but she had a joke about how that's like just opening your front door just in case somebody's there that's so true that's basically what I'm doing is there someone here no there's not okay I'll close it again that's basically what you do when you're just checking your phone when you do check your phone for no good reason yeah it's like opening your front door just to check if someone's there but it's also like finding yourself standing at the door with the door open and you're like oh I was going to the kitchen to make a cup of tea and I'm standing at the door for some reason you're standing at the door yeah exactly I do that with like you know Twitter I'll go on my phone because I need to get I need to find an email that someone sent me from last week because I've got to do a specific thing and then I realize and then I'm scrolling through Twitter I'm like whoa wait a minute I thought I was doing any writing an email how did this happen um because you open your phone and there it is and then and then it gets you like that but you can get apps Sorry I cut you off that's all right okay well I was gonna say I'm gonna say it now um um you can get apps that stop you from accessing certain other apps at times that you fix yeah yeah yeah yeah so you can't open Facebook except between this time and this time or Twitter in your case or but in order to to do that you need to go into your phone open up that app and decide the hours that you want and what would happen to me is I'd go in I'd be like right I'm going to set my my my allowances or my time windows and then oh I'm on Twitter so you'd never actually never actually get there because there's always some other app that's like hey yeah jumping in the world they do yeah literally yeah that is what yeah yeah so I think that's why I don't like my phone I I tend to find I have happier more fulfilling moments when I'm when I keep my phone at a distance you know you kind of live in the moment a lot more um and that's that's good yeah so all right so cycling to Berlin then yes are you going to tell us about this yes let's see let's see where this takes us probably to Berlin probably in terms of the conversation so okay when where how why uh what which uh whom um which which I don't know which which uh which route did you take uh good good question what's the difference between what and which that's a question that students ask me sometimes oh I would say well the reason I asked then when Luke said which I said which what because which suggests a choice between multiple options so we can use it either when the options are clear like here which route did you take so you're talking about the various possible routes from Paris to Berlin um or if it's just implicitly clear like if you said which color is your favorite it's obviously a limited number of colors yes yeah although of course some people would argue that that is not a limited number of colors well there's the inlet really well because it's well I suppose it is limited but all of the possible shades yeah you get that kind of spectrum um yeah okay see what you mean but anyways when you go on the internet and you want to choose a color for a particular thing if you're making some artwork or something then yeah then there are many many many many little codes and sub codes and you know if you break it down that's true but you could still say which color is your favorite yeah probably what is your favorite color would be the most common question so anyway so the point is that which is normally when there's a sort of limited number of options available for example if you've got like three cakes on the table which cake would you like um we have got cake I know yeah I don't know I should say Kate brought cake of course you thought of the example of cakes there's not a choice of cakes cake is always a good example for for most most situations yeah Kate did bring cake I should say the Kate brought the cake not the cake brought Kate has that and that wouldn't be possible it would be interesting if a cake brought you here uh I don't know how that would be possible who knows one day when the cakes become sentient as well as the phones then um maybe we'll be riding around on cakes that's the future we have to look forward to but I think cakes have got further to go with the phones I'm gonna put that out there in terms of sentience but phones are always developing always sort of changing apparently getting better but Cakes you know maybe they they've finished you know they're already great they are they don't need to be improved you know as a concept I think so you did bring cake uh which you haven't like some cake well you know what often I will uh share comments uh from the comment section one said it's rude to eat on a podcast is that what you're going to say I read that and I I had to say to that person I'm sorry you're just gonna have to deal with it yeah really yeah really really because okay so do you do you think first of all the vast majority of comments were extremely positive oh okay no no no no no go on no the I'm just saying this just for posterity you know just so everyone knows like the vast number of comments are positive and whenever I talk about comments if I ever bring up negative comments I always feel like I should balance it by saying it most people's comments were positive so I don't first of all give the impression like uh you know the the one comment out of uh 100 comments was negative that by just talking about the negative one that that somehow it makes it more significant than the others you don't want to give it more weight yeah exactly yeah you should have yeah yeah yeah um yeah and also uh I can't remember the other points I was going to make in my list I think I said what several reasons but never mind what the first one will do um but yeah so vast majority of comments were positive but there was one comment that simply said I think eating on a podcast is rude it's like that's that was the contribution that that person made to to the conversation um there was don't you don't you think so though because I think that person you know although you know that was the only thing they said yes I think that that person might have a point that there's this that as you know that there's one that you know when people are listening they don't necessarily want to hear could you hear that no I don't think we could I don't think that uh eating was audible well because I think I think when I ate because it was only me who was eating as well wasn't it because you'd already eaten that's right I gave you some of the cake that I bought yeah yeah um I think that when I ate I ate while you were talking and yeah so you were like eating I was away from the microphone yeah so I think it's rude to eat in somebody's ear yes I would agree with that um and if you eat into a microphone that you know people are going to listen to that's like eating into someone's ear yeah so if the listener can hear the sounds of eating yes that's rude I think that's rude but if the listener is aware that a human is eating yes in the room that's not rude per se is it because I wouldn't say that's rude but I don't I'm not 100 sure that you couldn't ever hear me eating but I think yeah maybe there was just one single like sound in the background maybe it was just like the wind blowing the door against the the door frame I do have a large mouth but not quite that large yeah though that's not really anything like the sound of anyone eating but um no when there's a little background noise sometimes these sounds can can come indistinguishable from each other um so I would disagree with that person yeah so what you're saying is that there's a difference between eating on the podcast and then eating uh professionally professional podcast eating which is eating away from the microphone only when another person is talking so you're not going yeah good point you know not that but instead you've now done which I've now done but there was no food in my mouth so that was a similar that wasn't so real Edison find it more polite for you to make eating noises while not eating or to eat but stay away from the microphone eat but make no noises or make noises but not eat which one is worse yeah that's the question that's the question to pretend to be eating into everybody's ears lovely cake delicious um yeah I like that thanks yeah you could put headphones on by the way Kate I've got right so I can hear that so you can hear that even more yeah yeah I forgot to mention that you can put them on if you why should I put them on uh just in case you um want to get a sense of your proximity to the microphone you know because that can that can that can help can you hear can you hear that louder quieter I don't know okay well that sounds I think it's about the same volume as you people do sometimes ask me that uh in comments why are you wearing headphones they don't ask it in that voice but that's the voice that enters my head when I read that comment and um it's just because it helps you monitor the sound it helps you know if you're close or far from the microphone you know and because of the proximity effect you see the closer you are to the microphone the more you sound like uh you're on the radio and the further away you get you know you can use the proximity for different purposes if you want to shout for example you shout off the microphone if you want to if you want to whisper you have to whisper close to the microphone so hearing your own Voice through the microphone helps you to deal with all of those things professional podcasting advice uh all I was thinking while you were talking was this would be a great time for me to have a bit of cake yeah because I was like now he's going off on it Luke is talking for a while yeah yeah well all right so I don't know what's the jury conclusion what's the conclusion well you've you've given it you've you've made it an audience participation question this isn't a live podcast yeah I know so how will we know ultimately I'm the boss I decide I think we can eat but we eat responsibly and if you're listening drinking alcohol you should do that responsibly yeah mostly I think you should do most things responsible yeah that's true but certainly some of them should be done with more of a sense of responsibility than others because like drinking alcohol can go badly wrong yeah whereas drinking tea is how wrong can it get I mean you might need to rush to the lou after a certain amount of time but that's that's probably as bad as it's gonna get isn't it yeah well you could slosh it all down yourself tea is hot so you could spill it on someone and actually quite hurt them yeah so these are examples of how you should drink tea responsibly yeah there we go make sure it goes into your mouth and down your throat and not all over someone not all over someone or yourself because you could burn yourself and that would be inconvenient yeah okay well yeah I just heard you drinking the tea I know I'm sorry to that person genuinely right that that person who commented and said that thought that was rude you know we don't mean to be rude or anything I'm sorry if your experience was diminished by the the even the thought of a person eating yeah um I get it but I don't I don't think you could hear us eating you could hear me eating but perhaps I'm wrong yeah yeah we'll see we'll see when that person comes back with a similarly uh uh uh Kurt uh reply maybe their name is Kurt yeah um I don't think it was but okay look look at this uh everyone video viewers uh listeners will describe let me see if the video is working yeah the video is working so my computer's just kind of went and how do you know the computer's a lot it is it continues to record even in the background no I was going to say how do you know what could be seen on camera all right okay I need to describe this to the audio listeners I'm holding a tin in my hands it's a circular a round tin with uh Marmite on the front of a picture a nice design of a jar of Marmite there's a whole other conversation that can be done Marmite is a sort of a yeast extract spread which is a great way of selling it but anyway it's also describing it because nobody listening to that knows what that tastes like no well that's yeast let's let's put Mars it is what it is let's put Marmite on the side for a moment all right and we may come back to Marmite because it's very easy for us to get distracted by one thing or another especially marmite and I'm holding this thing and I've got to you know I've got to continue to take the leg off um so all right metal tin it's round there's a nice picture of Marmite on the front but that's not uh what's inside we take off the lid what do we have inside cupcakes beautiful cupcakes oh I can smell them as well I can smell vanilla yeah good so can you describe the cupcakes yes so um the cupcakes I brought cupcakes because last time I think I talked about cake but I hadn't brought it and it was the first video episode we've done and I felt um quite self-conscious about the fact that I hadn't actually brought cake even though it's suddenly a visual medium no most people don't bring cake to things you know that it's not like the standard that you have to try to make all my friends yeah I bring cake bribe them with cake yes and then people are like oh we should invite her to stuff because she'll bring cake this is how I make my friends during lockdown I was studying Patisserie at home and became friends with all of my neighbors because I live alone yeah so I was making loads and loads of Patisserie so I would make like 16 croissant and then be like wow I should probably deliver these to people instead of eating them alone it's very nice and really contributing to the to the community yeah and then I became friends with those people and incidentally they invited me to Berlin that's why I went to Berlin ah but anyway it does all connect it does all make sense um so the cakes are um so you said you can spell vanilla yeah I think so what kind of cake would they be in British cake terms uh Victoria sponge correct oh I got it right listeners Victorious thing if you're really British or not Victoria's sponge cake is uh it's yeah it's kind of kind of cake that's got vanilla flavoring yes it's um it's a very sort of simple cake um they have the same cake in French and they call it the four quarters they're wrong it's Victoria sponge it is Victoria sponge but they they call it that because it's there are four parts essentially the same quantity of each butter sugar flour and eggs and then you also for the flavoring you put in vanilla Essence and um baking powder which was invented um quite near in time to the coronation of Queen Victoria so when Queen Victoria was crowned they invented a new like national dish as they do for coronations as you've probably mentioned on your podcast um and baking powder was a British invention that was taking off because it makes cakes rise and it makes them light and fluffy so it's quite a quite a revolution in cake making yeah um and therefore they made this this sponge where previously all the kind of cakes that were made in the UK and I think in many cultures were much heavier and they would be you know like fruit cakes with dried fruit raisins that sort of thing so it would be a heavier cake whereas now they had learned how to make lighter cakes and that's why um the Victoria sponge ended up being the coronation dish when Queen Victoria was crowned that's that's from my memory I might have got a few facts a little bit wrong um yeah no it sounds I'm not sure no no I can't factor that in my own head but it sounds right yeah that makes sense Victoria's sponge cake named after Queen Victoria because of all the things you said I'm not just going to repeat them no you can I could but why that might be why our last episode was two hours yeah just repeat everything you say uh I do that a lot but when Queen Elizabeth was crowned there was a coronation dish coronation chicken coronation chicken yeah which is what is coronation chicken again do you know do you know this it's chicken yeah in a sauce and it's a yellow Source it's got almonds and raisins in right there must be some sort of like turmeric or yeah something like that in it probably something some kind of Spice from India or something like that right uh yes kind of like a very watered-down milded version like English version of an Indian dish it's very mild yeah it's not spicy it's spicy at all yeah no it's very creamy so it's kind of like a chicken in a in a creamy sauce uh with Raisins and Almonds and probably some spices and stuff but it's not it's not actually hot spicy yeah it's quite nice yeah yeah yeah and then when King King Charles was crowned what was it coronation quiche but the French apparently were not happy with this because apparently I didn't even look at the recipe I heard it wasn't actually a quiche because it doesn't have cream yeah an egg I don't know I'm not sure what according to the French uh makes a quiche a quiche and is it like creme fresh or egg or something that has to be in there I think it needs to have egg and cream right to be a quiche and this and otherwise it's a tart I see okay because you can have like a you can have a sweet tart like an apple tart or you could have a Savory tart like a vegetable tart and so if it doesn't have egg and cream I think it's a tartar not a quiche mm-hmm I think so the the coronation quiche as it was called what was it it was it was a vegetarian I have no idea what it was it was vegetarian which made some people angry why because they're idiots sorry you're not supposed to call people it has to be the sacrificial killing of a creature yeah yeah they wanted they wanted to put um a remainer in it um probably that was a very old brexity joke yeah let's not explain it it's not funny um um but I think that there was courgette there was courgette in it right it was a kind of vegetable maybe part of something I can't believe you I think it was vegetarian because I think I remember people being angry about that probably shouldn't talk about it anymore because neither of us know what yeah but I'm pretty sure there was courgette or some other maybe broccoli or something and the overall impression I got of the coronation quiche was that could be very soggy that was my first thought good that's vegetarian nice one Charles uh but uh sulky probably quite soggy but who knows he probably didn't cook it himself I doubt it maybe he likes cooking I don't know yeah I expect so so hmm lovely cupcakes yeah Victoria sponge yeah with um what do you call the butter cream buttercream buttercream whipped buttercream on the top yeah and a raspberry yeah which is the the proverbial cherry on top of it indeed oh my goodness here we go again the cherry on top of the cake it's actually a raspberry this time yeah it is the raspberry on top of the cupcake when you eat when you eat it you have to you have to cut it in half oh yeah down the middle because there's a surprise in the middle what have you put in these I've ruined it now because it would have been better if you hadn't known but then I think that might have ruined the eating quietly you're curious to know what what's inside these things it's nothing it's nothing revolutionary no no I don't think so yeah okay am I gonna be able to drive after I think yes do you drive no well you know operate heavy machinery do you do that no not really but you know what I'm saying yeah yeah um yeah and it's not like in the middle I've put like minced beef or something it's a good surprise it's a good surprise hmm I reckon there's chocolate in the middle do you know yeah that's what I reckon maybe something like a kind of a a a hazelnut chocolate or something like that are you going for Nutella but not naming the ground Nutella but not Nutella yeah yeah a better version like without all that palm oil and grief inside you know orangutan um grief the second time we've talked about orangutans I think we started talking about orangutans before we start before we press records so they're like what orangutans I don't remember this reference very rude to talk about orangutans without without context oh so I read some other comments one said that I laughed too much oh yeah there was one person who just took exception to and I and I think I replied saying I think you'll find that Paul Taylor who's a regular guest on this podcast is famous for for laughing on the show yeah so you don't aim us for it yeah he is yeah he's famous for laughing uh on on the show uh in fact there's a they've got a jingle yeah I don't really do Jingles that much yeah Amber and Paul Amber and Paul I've got a jingle and in the jingle it's basically a condensed version of all the comments that people had made about the two of them the first one is that Amber's got a lovely voice and the second one is she has she does yeah yeah yeah and the second one is that Paul um laughs and everyone enjoys his laughter Oh wow so it's like okay so he can laugh that's fine but um Kate I'm laughing from okay no laughing no eating I'm I mean I feel like my right to drink tea is hanging by a thread right now you just we're just we're asking for it now I'm gonna do it anyway someone's gonna someone's gonna say no liquidity no no imbibing of liquids allowed okay it was breathing too much yeah um so can I switch that yeah yeah don't worry it's still recording but I don't like to not be able to see it really yeah I just need to know that the video is recording every now and then listeners my laptop goes to sleep and the screen goes all uh dark and Kate's like ah no what's happened I don't know why because it's not like it's nice to watch yourself I think it's because I'm checking if I'm still very red and the answer is yes I'm just thinking is this microphone uh is this positioned correctly because I don't know I don't want it to like get in the way so that people can't actually see you but at the same time I want it to be able to capture your voice should I move uh uh it's good this is good yes this is good yeah German I know is he cycle to Berlin I think this episode might be called cycling Kate Billington cycle to Berlin and we cycled around the topic it took us 90 minutes to actually talk about it um no but I just wanted to say one other thing about your comments some people said that I laugh too much which no just one person but some people said that they didn't understand me because they tried too quickly and I think somebody said because I talked too quickly and because I was laughing that was just the laughing it's just one person yeah if it's just one person and then forget about it okay so um but I have had that comment before you're difficult to understand no that I laugh too much like on the mini English lessons you know those quite a few of those have comments underneath that just say things like why is she always laughing and I think that is valid because I'm laughing at nothing some of them say she's laughing at nothing and that's true but you know what I don't think it's just you I think this is a sort of maybe an English thing and I've noticed this too in various places that uh ushing us English people we do and I don't know if it's just English people or whatever but uh we do sort of laugh sometimes when there isn't necessarily an obvious thing to laugh about no one has made a joke you just say something whatever and then there's laughter what does that laughter mean what why why do we do this is it because we're awkward as a nation yeah I think we're awkward yeah which just means that we're a bit socially uncomfortable so we laugh as a way of saying what what does that laughter actually mean it's like uh um I guess it's kind of like uh I'm finding this a little bit funny because I don't know I don't know I don't know if I was laughing awkwardly though I am British but I'm not a very awkward British person hmm it's hard to explain it's hard to explain isn't it yeah but again we shouldn't probably shouldn't dwell too much on no well some individuals find a bit annoying for that I'm just going to continue to be someone who laughs too much it's you know there's there's going to be something you don't like about everyone and if that's the thing you don't like about me I think it's okay maybe there are other things maybe maybe now all the comments will be a list things we don't like about Kate number one she laughs too much number two she doesn't care that she laughs too much but number three is valid she talks too quickly so I'm going to make an effort on this one to talk more slowly yeah but you say that right but again I mean I've having done this for quite a long time and having read a lot of comments over the years and received emails and all the rest of it okay so on one hand yes we should try to maybe control the speed of speaking and stuff like that but if we if we speak too slowly and if people get the impression that we are adapting our speech other people will come in the comments and say speak naturally please speak normally we want you to speak at the natural speed we can understand you but we can't understand native speakers we need to get practice of listening to people speaking at natural speed okay so there's there's going to be someone else if we make that change someone else is like why did you move it it was better when it was here yes you know can't please everyone can't please everyone it's true yeah that's right yeah all right but I do think I was speaking too quickly and well I understood you yes so how do you judge speaking too quickly what um maybe one of the reasons you understood me though is because we have a lot of cultural commonalities commonalities you're speaking American English again what did you say last time you said it in a in an American accent it was like uh something else you said and I said for sure that should be supposed is that how we speak in in Great Britain in his Majesty's Land where's my phone narrative I don't know I can tell you what the word was so you were saying you write it down no because someone commented on that just uh today I think oh yeah yeah yeah yes yeah it was like Luke was right I checked the dictionary and it wasn't really it wasn't really a thing to disagree about don't worry uh that's okay I believe that you were right okay this is fun Luke looks up something on his phone so you were you were talking no you were talking about how uh we understand each other because we have a lot of commonalities a lot of things in common I think a lot of cultural things in common we have quite similar accents and similar patterns of speech I think it's I think I do speak more slowly if I'm speaking to somebody whose first language is English but who isn't British oh yeah yes so if you're speaking to to Dylan not the the Dylan I mentioned but the other thing is from uh the states he's from New York right if he's speaking to Dylan it's like you have to speak very slowly to Dylan because he's America doesn't understand he's a married he's from yeah yeah no what I mean is there's some vocabulary I probably wouldn't use yeah like what what if he saw Dylan who's from America the North America the United States of America I mean because there are some people who like get annoyed when you say America when you mean the United States of America understandably yeah um so what would it be true he is from America but we can be more precise true yes um yeah so it'd be like some English sentence like all right mate wasn't pears it was yeah not that you would use that's not what I meant but like once I um can't find this comment no I don't that's okay let me know another time yeah once I had like a text conversation with an American friend who was going to meet me somewhere and um he said I'm just getting some food on my way do you want me to get you anything and I replied no I've already eaten tar and he arrived to visit me or to I don't know what we were doing to hang out yeah um and he said what's tar what did you eat yeah but it's task about ta and it just means thank you um but it's very British and I think it's also used in New Zealand and maybe in Australia potentially surprised yeah um New Zealand I'm pretty sure about but I don't know about Australia um so it is used in other places but it's not used in America in the USA it means thanks by the way it means thanks I did say that did you you did okay just clarify well you know I have to repeat everything you say you have to repeat everything I say I have to repeat everything you say okay good um so I said yes exactly when I said I said to him I've already had some tar he thought that was a food item that I had eaten yeah so then he arrived and wanted to know what tar was yeah and you're like if it's like marmite it's very British you wouldn't understand this is still this is still here in the background by the way meaning we have to talk about this are you putting it on a shelf so we can so we can see it the listeners will see it and we will forget about it love it um can we have more tea the listeners will see it did you get that that was a mistake I meant the viewers will see it the listeners will be able to hear the uh the the Marmite calling to us the tin lid they'll you'll be able to hear it on the Shelf at the back of the room you won't I think I'm gonna sneeze now oh my God another one another taboo I'm not allowed to sneeze you have to say excuse me excuse me yeah you didn't say bless you bless you I was too busy like uh Wicket keeping for your sneeze so many Cricket references today yeah yeah yeah the sneezing yeah yeah I've sneezed on the podcast in the past and have not said excuse me because normally we don't I normally do say excuse me but I was distracted by the fact that there was a lot going on yeah yeah you see what I mean a lot going on that's right that's why I just press record and then that's done yes um but yeah I've sneezed on the podcast before and I had comments saying I think it was very rude that you didn't say excuse me yeah it's true you should say excuse me you should do especially if you sneeze directly into someone's ear I didn't do that I caught the sneeze yeah you did you caught the sneeze meaning you didn't let the sneeze pow come out explosively no no it's the healthier way to sneeze I have to say not for other people not for other people true only for the person who's sneezing good point but I've I've been told that uh if you hold a sneeze in that uh you lose a few brain cells when you sneeze I don't know if that's true that's one of those nonsense facts that's not I don't believe that for a second firstly we're all losing brain cells all the time anyway you lose a brain cell by laughing or nodding they lose a brain cell when you laugh as well apparently apparently they do yeah um really but then we're also developing new ones no I think that stops after a certain age oh right yeah we were only going downhill now I'm not sure what age it is well this is my very vague understanding of brain cells that there are so many of them that we are just constantly losing them every like every minor impact means you lose brain cells we don't make new ones I don't know about the new ones I think I don't I think that's um I think that stops after a certain age no I don't think you do yeah yeah well my listeners can tell if any any long-term listeners if you've been listening to this show for let's say over 10 years uh you can give me an assessment of whether you think of developed any new brain cells in that time or if it's just been a downward uh Trend since the first time maybe you first listen you thought Luke's reasonably intelligent and these days he's like who am I listening to like a chimpanzee we found a microphone what's what is this yeah maybe they are thinking that can I can I segue into a little language Point sure don't you think it's interesting that the expression to go downhill could be positive or negative because if or not exactly to go downhill but like for example it's all downhill from there it could mean everything's got easier yeah it's like riding a bike right you're riding uphill that's hard work and then you get to the top of the hill or the top of the mountain or whatever and then it's all downhill from there it's so easy yeah you just Freewheel so if you're talking about literally so there's the literal expression and then there's the idiomatic version because if you said if you were working on like a long-term project you could say like right I need to get all of these aspects of the project done and lined up and then it's all downhill from there but wouldn't you don't you think though that the potential because this so the expression can mean you're essentially freewheeling like on a bicycle the best part of riding a bike when you go down a hill yeah you just Freewheel all the way down yeah but also we use it to mean oh you know when you you get to 50 years old and then you know you've you've lost so many brain cells it's basically all downhill from there it's not getting anything everything's getting worse things are going down getting worse which is something that I think people say right up to 50 that seems Young I heard someone say that on a podcast recently was it yours no no it wasn't just me hearing myself say it just now just now um I heard that that's so funny I heard it 30 seconds ago yeah that was no that was me that was me but I heard it on a podcast I think yesterday uh talking about you get to 50 and then it's still downhill from there basically they meant everything gets easier but it's like riding a bike yeah maybe in the last episode you disagree with this because you your belief is that as you get older you get better you talked about aging yeah I said on YouTube about being a grumpy old man no you told you talked I'm doing it look I'm pointing I'm pointing man you talked about me being a grumpy old man because he pointed at me probably I talked about me becoming wise like a wizard and you were like what because I think in your head when I say that the older I get the more like a wizard I become I think in your head we're like What like Harry Potter they're children Wizards no anyway I think that's what happened okay did I mention Harry Potter no but that's why I'm that I'm just I I'm I think I'm reading that I'm I thought that oh God so I said as I get all older I feel kind of good because I'm gonna get more like a wizard and you're like what what are you talking about oh no I just think the older you get the better you get I think I said that last time yeah so yeah I would apply that to you and if you think that means becoming wizard D wizard-like yeah I almost said Wizardry and then I was like that's the noun that's not an adjective isn't it wizard but that's that's negative yeah that means all like dried up if I think a plant could be wizened she didn't water it yeah I suppose so um shriveled shriveled yes um please can we have more tea yeah of course thank you uh we you didn't we I think we didn't finish the point about uh going downhill did we or so is that done now but go on I think the point I was trying to make was that in many contexts it would mean that things have gone things have got worse like you might say oh that used to be a really nice restaurant but then they got in a new chef and it's gone downhill yeah for example that's clearly in the context and from the tone of voice and everything um that clearly means it's not as good as it used to be yes but then if yeah I think if you're working on something difficult and then you say so don't worry guys we've done most of the hard work now it's you know we've got over the hump of this project it's just all downhill from now plain sailing for cruising smooth sailing you could say as well yeah but I I was going to say that uh you know uh it might be wouldn't you avoid using it's going down it's all downhill now because of the potential misunderstanding in the back of people's minds and be like uh what negative that it's got too many negative connotations so you'd be using more positive language it's plain sailing with freewheeling it's it's three-wheeling that suggests yeah that would be more because that's still the same image of going downhill because when you're freewheeling you'd have to Pedal especially in the corporate environment you've got to be very sort of everything's going to be positive advised all the time I wouldn't know that's why I don't have one of those jobs yeah well me me too but this is what I've I've I've I've perceived to be the case that everything has to be made or positive foreign do I not normally say that you're right no I think you do you do do I yeah yeah it's fine okay uh these these cupcakes look so tantalizing I keep showing them to the camera as if I'm selling them um once upon a time I was going to circle you were yes people who've listened to other episodes will know you were talking about becoming a chef that's right anyway we've got to talk about you cycling to Berlin because I think that might be the title of this episode and some people are gonna be like never mind that the laughing and the eating just talk about the thing that was on the label you can change the title though it's not like the titles yeah free yeah determined yeah yeah well with when you're titling an episode yeah you've got to be it's got to be quite Punchy and it's got to kind of make people listen title of the last one okay Billington in the podcast just it did you know just descriptive yeah oh go so while we're talking about things that are catchy yeah can I ask your listeners for some advice sure I want a new Instagram handle so my Instagram handle used to be cake underscore by underscore cake underscore underscore Paris Paris yeah uh which as you can tell I was impressed that you knew any of that um but it's not very catchy especially those underscores yeah all of the underscores and also I created it when I wanted to open a cake shop in Paris so it made sense um but now I don't want to do that and I mostly use Instagram for comedy so I want an Instagram handle that is catchy that is not already taken a lot of them are taken um that preferably would refer to cake and comedy so at the moment I've changed it to cakey comedy which is rubbish isn't it let's be honest could be better yeah it's bad um so I need to find something else like um Anna who we were talking about earlier who's a friend of a friend of mine who you also know yeah would that be accurate um yes she's a good friend of mine she runs comedy shows in Paris and her Instagram handle is anatomically correct which is really good very good because anatomically correct would mean anatomic would mean like for a biological drawing yes of an of a plant or an animal or probably an animal because I don't know yeah Anatomy yeah yeah um it means that the the drawing the diagram is correct um biologically all the body parts are there so we'd call it anatomically correct like for example The Simpsons that's not it's not anatomically correct picture of Homer Simpson that is four fingers on each hand right not anatomically correct correct um but Anna came up with this Instagram handle and also she's a scientist so it's got that like science side to it and it's such a good Instagram it's very clever yes anatomically correct it's really good and I need something that good but so my cousin came up with top of the Billington hey uh yeah didn't we talk about this before did we I mentioned that before ah have we talked because the first I think I said top of the Billington is the is is the best suggested that or at least verified that I remember because my cousin coming up with it for sure but maybe you could also come up I think I think maybe you said this to me before and I was like top of the Billington yeah it is a good one it is a good one but I want something that has cake in it this tin has got cake in it and it's mine perfect ow uh topper the Billington I don't know what can you do with that how can you add cake to that I don't know maybe it hasn't maybe it's got to be something different and not top of the Billington um yeah on top of that you see that we're going to explain top of the bill if you're top of the bill yeah it means there's a bill is the list of performers that are on a show like a play bill that's a um in the states they still use the today they use the term Play Bill but we would call it a program right when you arrive if you go to the theater you get um a list a piece of paper with the actors names on it and that's yeah we would call it a program they would call it a playbill yeah and you also see like posters for Glastonbury music festival and the you know there's like a list of performers on different stages and then the one that's at the top of the bill is in the big letters like Elton John and then other performers afterwards so uh top of the bill is in reference to a show of something and you can say you could say somebody is top billing as well at top billing artists yes or a top billing comedian yes would mean that if they're on like a variety show or a festival or whatever they'll always be at the top of the list yeah I think yeah it's an adjective phrase right yeah yeah I agree so top of the Billington is is good I mean yeah it's a reference to Comedy and being on a show and uh yeah it's also sort of selling yourself as well yeah like because you're overselling you wouldn't want to say I mean you have to sell yourself a fairly rubbish comedian yeah like you know sort of mid to lower mid-tier comedian yeah you know you wouldn't do that in comedy you have to try and sell yourself as much as you can including taking any single positive thing that anyone has ever said about you and putting it into the poster you know um and things like that so you sell yourself I think top of the Billington is very good why do you need cake in there that always has to be cake why you're still holding on to the cake because there's always because you're right there always has to be cake it does there though this is my question does they're really Kate maybe you need to let the cake go maybe I do just I haven't even taken a picture of these cakes they're not gonna be on Instagram it's just going to be Kate without K yeah you can do it this is maybe they don't need the cake but maybe they get invited to parties Luke because because they're inviting you for UK not for the cake that's the dream the cake helps I'm not gonna lie people like the cake yes well you really do that's really a good thing I'm not saying you should burn all the cakes um I have burnt cake I'm sure you have it's all part of the learning process but but um I think top of the Billington it's going to be difficult to beat that for an Instagram handle but then I don't know how how about this top of the top of the Billington brackets cake close brackets that's so good there's some cake there's cake there at least you didn't take in there there it is but then I don't know do I need to pass your tea bags oh yeah make us a brew I remember this tin from last time yep I just held up for the camera um so I'm all right I'm still I'm still going with my cup oh are you warm my least favorite phrase in the English language lukewarm yeah where's it from lukewarm I've no idea why we say oh okay wow let's hold that we're gonna put I'm gonna put lukewarm over there with the Marmite right okay because let's finish the thing we were talking about which is your Instagram handle top of the Billington what do you think listeners is there any way of getting cake in there does she need to put cake in there or is top of the Billington instagram.com it's not an email address that's not how Instagram works it's not I have a really limited understanding of how Instagram works but you're telling me even I know that it's not top of the Billington at instagram.com I don't work for Instagram surprisingly I don't know why they haven't employed me despite the fact we've mentioned them a number of times now this is basically product placement yeah no I don't understand Instagram either people keep asking me like why aren't you on Instagram like that honestly you are now I am I have been for ages but I don't use it no it's just one I've just got one image on it which is a poster of me performing comedy alongside other comedians from like 2017 or something like that so I don't I don't really use Instagram and that's because I just don't have the time to work out how it how to use it and then to actually use it so you won't know the answer to my next question which is if somebody had my old Instagram handle from like a like I had business cards when I was going to open a cake shop for example okay so if they found that and then they searched for it on Instagram would it send them to my new one can you redirect yeah I I mean I don't have to do anything I just want if if somebody searches for it on Instagram will it redirect to my current name you're asking the wrong person I I know I don't know sometimes your listeners might know but also I think perhaps this is a problem I don't need to worry about because I don't think that's going to happen very much is it let's be honest are there not like other tags that are included in an Instagram profile like Kate Billington cake you know can you not add all those tags in so that when someone searches for these things if they search for cake underscore buy underscore cake underscore Paris instagram.com that they will they will find you because you'll include all those tags in your profile is that possible again we're asking people who know you do write like a like a bio they call it I think you write a little description of yourself mine's just it just says I think it says stand up stand up cakes and cycling I think that's what it says okay can you not include formally cake underscore by underscore cake at instagram.com I bet if I Google this I'll find the answer I don't know why I've brought it up in conversation with you of all people hive mind that's why because you you know because of the other people using the hive mind of of the listeners of Luke's English podcast to to find out the answer um I'm still I've got three things now in my mind four four things thing number one should we eat cupcakes obviously I want to but there's just the managing that while also talking to you and that one person who's like fuming right now there might be more than one oh there will be more than one I've heard this before I've heard I've heard this uh from audience and from other people on other podcasts the phenomenon of of eating on a microphone and and some people feel so strongly about it that I generally would would advise against it as a professional podcaster right but you know that's I don't wanna down the law too much because you've gone to the effort of making cupcakes and that's fantastic and I actually want to eat one and I think the last time not the last time but when I when I was on the podcast a few years ago and we did two quite close together and then there was a very like a two year break yeah I think during both of those ones both times I brought food yeah and I think we ate it during the podcast I think so too hmm maybe because there was a video version of the last one this person was aware that cake was being eaten was the comment on the YouTube it was our nose on the website which suggests that they listen to the audio version although the YouTube version is also available it's embedded on the website page there's no way of knowing and to cut a long story short we should probably not uh give that comment a lot more air time that's Credence but yeah but it is in my mind and I'm aware of the the the the the the issue of eating on a podcast um so that's one thing another thing is um I think my rule is yeah if they can't hear it it's fine that's my rule okay okay um says the person who doesn't have a podcast well you know you can't please all the people all the time and uh it would be a shame not to eat some cupcake and let's see if we can do cupcake it's professional cupcake eating I bet I could be a professional cupcake I think you could definitely I'm not sure about me I don't know if I could manage that my dream job professional professional cupcake eater yeah do you have a knife um I should have brought one shouldn't I I thought I had some um I've got a spoon what can we use to cut the cake in half should we use the edge of the fork okay um maybe we should use the tin lid as a plate unless you have plate okay so so there should be the cupcakes that's one thing another thing in my mind I'm voting yes I'm eating a cup where's Marmite yes another thing was uh lukewarm and then another thing was the potential top burst uh title of the episode which is uh Kate Billington cycled to Berlin but doesn't talk about it very much yeah you want to use the cake lid as a as a uh plate I think that's a good idea I think that's a good idea too Choose Your Weapon that's an English expression meaning which cake would you like I'd like this one please look look they've been individually wrapped it would be it would be rude to Kate not to eat this do you understand do you understand You've Lost That listener forever Luke and it's my fault look I love all my listeners okay and and people have absolutely have the right to be uh to find it rude if you know someone is eating in their ear I understand I understand but I understand also there's a there's a there's a process going on here it's not as simple as you might think and there are many different competing factors that might cause a person to even knowingly eat a cake on a podcast you see it's not just as simple as you might think it's so much from the from the point of view of the listeners or viewers it's all very it's almost two-dimensional right there's just like uh I can't even explain the complex in a workings of a person's brain and all the different things that are swirling around while recording whereas when you actually watch it it looks like yeah one thing just leads to another thing and you don't get the sense of all the complex uh uh social uh and psychological forces that are at work I'm rambling so much because I can't multitask I don't know what you're talking about I don't know either what I'm talking about but I'm never mind and what shall I do here what's the appropriate thing so there's the there's the the raspberry sounds really impatient just just cut it in half cut it in half okay the the raspberry gets cutting off this is the bit that Kate's been waiting for where the contents of the cupcaker revealed and I thought it would be something chocolaty maybe a kind of Nutella but better better Nutella there are other other hazelnut chocolate spreads are available is it what is it it's Jam yeah it's Jam ladies and gentlemen what kind of jam what do you think well it should I was just I would say raspberry jam because it would be the raspberry might feel a bit put out if it was strawberry jam or never upset a raspberry that's one of my top life rules yeah this is great okay and you I was surprised that you guessed chocolate because Victoria sponges traditionally Jam contain Jam of course they do so I thought you would immediately say well if it's a Victoria sponge it'll have jamming yeah you know yeah well how does Bob Marley like it with jamming um okay now you've got the challenge now I'm gonna eat professionally which means I'm gonna set you a little speaking task oh I love a speaking task so I'd like you to explain um explain that the the expression lukewarm and I want you to also speculate on why you why it's my least favorite expression in the English language go so lukewarm is used um when something is uh tepid which means um it is not hot normally it means not hot enough so if for example your soup is tepid you probably want your soup to be hotter soup should be either hot or cold not so hot you can't drink it but like hot um but lukewarm is also used metaphorically to mean that you don't have very strong interest in something if you're kind of lukewarm on it it's like um you don't have a strong feeling in its favor you probably you probably don't mind it but you don't you definitely don't love it you feel lukewarm um I would assume it's Luke's uh least favorite expression because Luke often feels too cold and therefore when people use the word lukewarm he's like I wish I was warm but he's not so he says oh a horrible word taunting me with the thing I wish I had but I don't oh I'm wrong it's because um Luke doesn't like it because it means um something you don't like very much and it's rubbish to have your name in a word that means you don't like it very much I think that was obvious but I thought it would be funny it may be obvious but it needed to be put into words okay that's the that's kind of what this podcast is about right saying obvious things but what's not obvious is where it comes from do you know where it comes from um I was going to think of a witty response to that but then I thought that um no I don't know where where what's the origin of the phrase lukewarms etymology of that I can't believe you haven't looked that up as a Luke well you know I don't like the phrase so I'm just like eh no thanks I'm lukewarm when it comes to uh the phrase lukewarm I don't think you are I think he's actively dislike it yeah it's clear um yeah imagine having imagine having like another thing like um uh something negative if it was a cake right if there was a word to describe uh when you eat a cake and it's not very satisfying it's not moist enough it's too dry or something it's like yeah this it's it's a bit cake it's a bit Kate dry isn't it you'd feel a bit put out by that wouldn't you yeah listeners Kate has moved off the microphone a significant distance in fact you know what I could do I can mute her microphone Kate's microphone has been muted and now you don't even need to worry about whether she's eating cake or not okay it's all good yeah no skin off your nose she said which is another expression uh we might let that one slip um okay so there we go uh the cupcake has been tasted and it's very good it's very tasty indeed do I sorry do I think it's a bit dry um you mean Kate's dry that's not a nice phrase is it it's not it's see you see what I'm living with when it comes to lukewarm you know a Luke walrus or a lukewarm reception there's another collocation with it uh you know the launch of the product we were very disappointed with the launch of the new product why but it received a lukewarm reception from the uh from the uh customers you know please can you switch off my microphone again so I can have the other quarter of cake cakes Kate's microphone is being muted in three two one muted um so it's do I think it's a bit dry no I think it's fine I think it's really good um it's it's a fine line isn't it to to get the balance right between dry and then on the other hand uh soggy right which is the other The Other Extreme undercooked which I guess could lead to sogginess and then and then in the middle that sweet spot which is moist right but not too much so I think I think it's good I think it's great yeah very good tasty delicious thank you very much and and not so moist that it's that it makes a sound when you eat it you can eat it quite discreetly very well designed well engineered excellent good job what the other things in my brain there was also the word Marmite the whole Marmite thing so Kate's um tin uh has got a picture of Marmite on the top although there is no no Marmite in the middle basically to to put it in a nutshell Marmite is a is a spread that you might put on toast or toasted cheese sandwiches or other things are you ready to be unmuted yeah okay you're back what else would you put Marmite on crumpets crumpets which I also toasted normally Savory it's a it's not sweet very Savory right salty then salty yeah and uh the thing is about Marmite so it's made of yeast it's yeast extract which is not a great way of selling it uh but it's healthy I mean it's full of bit vitamin B12 I understand uh which is good but you don't think so you're supposed to put just a little bit on you don't spread it on like um butter or something just a little bit and um contains B vitamins it says yeah does it say which ones yeah probably yeah contains BMI B vitamins yeah maybe vitamins probably b12 vitamins I suppose isn't that the best one I don't know they they they kept working on the vitamin the B vitamins and they got to 12 are like we're done um uh and and so also Marmite is a reference point for things that either you love or hate yes yes like Marmite and Margaret Thatcher it's those it's those two things yeah I mentioned Margaret Thatcher Kate's eyes narrowed clearly there's there's there's um just the suggestion that anybody would hate Margaret Thatcher right um it's divisive it's a divisive thing people either love it or hate it and that's that was their slogan you love it or you hate it yeah that was and which I think is very clever marketing because it turned it into a thing yes to love it you were sort of declaring your side yeah but for a very long time I was sort of lukewarm on marmite no honestly yeah by which I mean I didn't have a strong I didn't mind it but I didn't love it so you're a third category of a person I ruined that advertising I thought humans are only in two categories people who love markets there's a third category I think Brits are supposed to be in one of two categories because if you are for example Australian Vegemite mate yeah exactly you would have strong opinions about Marmite not because you hate Marmite but because Australia and a few other countries have this other Marmite that's called Vegemite it's very similar but it does have a different taste um but I think therefore for example an Australian might love Vegemite and not hate Marmite for The Taste but hate it on principle but still hate it because there's rivalry yeah yeah okay or they might just be like it's just not as good yeah I think so probably yeah yeah I expect so but I think British people people who've grown up in Britain are supposed to have a strong opinion on Marmite that's what you're supposed to think you're supposed to think either love it or hate it yes that's what the advertising slogans tell you the other thing about Marmite as well just just to finish off before we start talking about cycling to Berlin at some point uh in the next 10 years um is that uh it's one of those foods that you get videos on YouTube and it's like Americans react to English food and it's always like a piece of toast with loads of Marmite on it and they eat it and they're like oh my God this is disgusting what is this um and they're eating it wrong because you're not supposed to put a huge dollop of it on you're just supposed to put a little liberal amount on top of your toasted cheese sandwich and it definitely improves it it gives it a lovely uh little Edge uh so there you go I would say not a liberal amount to me a liberal amount is a lot oh really yeah I I always thought a liberal amount was like a small amount oh God I must I'm wrong I'll be wrong Kate I'll be wrong you said that you were volunteering for it yeah we'll just Google it we don't get to choose Luke is that how it works no it was a prediction and maybe it maybe uh what what did I say uh maybe I was volunteering to be wrong yeah it did sound like you were volunteer but I think I am wrong a liberal amount uh meaning let's see yeah a large and generous right oh my God my my everything is my whole question my whole podcast Castle is crumbling to the ground now as every single listener questions all of the things I've ever said before maybe he said everything wrong in the past it doesn't even speak English now this isn't English what you're hearing this is this is a another language that only one person speaks it's very very similar to English in fact it's exactly the same yeah it's an idiot it's exactly the same as English except that in in Luke ish a liberal amount means a small amount that's the one difference other than that they are they are and the word lukewarm doesn't exist yeah that's right but Kate Drive does yeah yeah that's those are the differences and that's it so don't worry it's it's 99.9 recurring percent the same as English so we're we're fine I think everyone's got an idiotic haven't they yes that's why it's called an idiot yeah that's why it's called mediolect no um that's why the word exists for it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so tell us about cycling to Berlin then yes so wait a minute why did you why did you decide to do that and okay first of all clear let's get the the parameters okay in place so you cycle from Paris to Berlin no um because I decided I didn't quite have enough time so instead I took a train you thought I'm gonna need I need to get to Luke's pod room to talk about nothing for 45 minutes and then yeah go on yeah I took a train um to the border between France and Belgium to a little town called German um j-e-u-m-o-n-t it's called Uh and that's right it's just on the French side of the Border but that way I cut off about probably about 200 kilometers and and all the trouble that you'd have getting out of Paris yes because that's often the hardest part although to be fair I think I I would have I would have followed the canal which makes it much easier because if you you're just like unless you fall into it unless you fall in yeah yeah but you would have you would have done that I would have should have I know and I've just realized I said would have oh my God I know I said it because I didn't know what verb was coming next I was hesitating that's why yeah it's all right I just thought people will comment but there was a bit where she said would have well they will learn from Context that that's the way it goes sometimes we don't necessarily need to instruct the listeners in the language to show them all right how it's done by just doing it okay um okay so you chose to go you cut out some of that Journey yes um because well because so some friends invited me to Berlin because they were planning a trip there so a friend of mine um has a brother who lives in Berlin and so this group of friends planned a trip and they were going to stay with the brother um and there were originally seven people going um and then when I was talking to them at a party um the friend who's kind of a new friend for me um she said oh we're going to Berlin and you should come but they she thought we're going to Berlin we're gonna need cake yeah exactly exactly um I had just made a cake for that party and um it was for a friend of mine who had a lot to drink at that party she had a lot of wine yeah and we brought out the cake had 36 candles on it because she was 36 yeah she blew them all out and then she got up on a chair to make a speech and fell onto the cake it was amazing fortunately the candles had all been blown out yeah and removed or she felt no no no she felt she shoved the candle into the cake with her with her body weight wonderful she only fell onto the side of it so I was able to repair the cake yes by picking up the candles and using the icing to stick the cake back together and then I wrote on it happy birthday please don't fall on this again that was good so this is the friend who was going to Berlin she's part of the group the one who fell on the cake as part of the group yes I've not named her in case she listens to this the only my only regret about the cake falling is that there's no video of it because it was spectacular it could have been online right it could have been a line it would have been a big hit epic fails 2023. it's such a good video sorry it was such a good moment it would have been such a good video but anyway it doesn't exist um but at that party this other friend invited me to Berlin and it turned out they were going um at the first weekend in May which is the end of our school holiday so I looked at the calendar and I thought oh I have almost two weeks before of holiday before the weekend that they arrive in Berlin therefore maybe I could cycle there and that was where the idea came from okay so your route was from what was the name of that town again which is I'm I can't pronounce it no I think I can pronounce it correctly but it sounds exactly like if you said in French I'm lying really yeah because the French verb to lie is montyr right so I lie is I thought it was like which is another thing it's a different thing that's something else completely but it's not the same verb no is like okay it's like I am lying really yeah so there's a whole I mean is that that's not the etymology of that French I don't know maybe it is maybe the town doesn't really exist and people were like I'm gonna go to I'm lying I've come all the way from the Belgian French border whereabouts Jamal no no really oh so you didn't go yeah so you started there why there in particular because um the train went there and it was a it was so there's different types of trains and um you know in France they have a good high-speed training Network for example but you can't take a bike on a high-speed train very easily um often yeah they're very fast it's really difficult um no because they have um you've got to put it in like a special bag so it's almost like carrying a suitcase onto the train okay instead of carrying a bike on put the bike in a bag not the train not the train um I tried that it doesn't work either a big bag yeah big bag so I found trains um which are not the fast trains that are the ter um which is regional trains and you can take a bike on those easily um so that was why I picked that so it was a French train because when you're taking a train that crosses borders um it's just a bit more complicated to find a train that you can put a bike on so I didn't want to bother and also I wanted to do as much of it as I could as much of the journey as I could um just if I'd gone from Paris I think it would probably have been 11 or 12 days so literally the whole of my holiday oh my gosh and I just needed a bit of time to you know pack and plan my route in Paris before I left yeah because going from Paris to Berlin is what about a thousand kilometers if I didn't said having checked earlier if I'd done the whole thing I think it would have been 1100 right actually that's quite a lot it is quite far so I cut off a few hundred all right so you did something like 750 or 800 or something like that did you no no because no 100 1 100 minus 200. oh yeah yeah I did 930 to get there okay that's significant yeah it was great significant was it yeah very flat thank goodness for that I know all right so what was the route that you took exactly so I went across the bottom of Belgium uh into a tiny bit of the Netherlands the bit that um comes down in between Belgium and Germany um where Maastricht is okay um obviously a lot more of the Netherlands is further north um and then into Germany um I arrived in Germany quite in a Dusseldorf and the way that I planned it was essentially I took I planned the train to Jamal and then I opened Google Maps and I took a pen and I put the pen on the map between Jamal and Berlin and then that was my route so I planned the most direct route I possibly could put a pen on the map so it would make a straight line like putting a ruler on the map yeah right between Jamal and Berlin yeah and then I just looked along the map and every 100 kilometers or so I was like right that's where I'll spend the night and that that was what I did okay so that I would make it as direct as possible yeah yeah yeah because obviously I'm not going to take motorways or anything like that and and you can use things like Google Maps as a kind of guide to plan things and there were also established cycle routes all across Europe which are good but the problem with them is they often won't take you on the most direct route so you end up adding a lot of kilometers because it wants you to go along a scenic route and to visit these lovely Villages and things which is great if you've got the time but if you if your goal is to get somewhere it doesn't always work out so um how many days did it take nine nine yes eight nights nine days eight nights yes and then um after Berlin I also had another night on the road because I took two trains from Berlin back to Paris yeah um I took one train from Berlin to Baden Baden uh which is near Strasbourg but on the German side of the Border yeah and then I cycled from bad and Baden to Strasbourg but I stayed in between them I stayed the night in between them why is it called Barn why twice why not just Baden I'm not sure Bart means Bath in German so lots of spa towns have Bart in the name so this is like d it's like spa spa spa yeah okay it's like maybe I wonder if the city of bath in England was established first and they were like well it's like the German bath but it's better than English bath so let's call it bath bath right twice as good as bath so good they named it twice yeah New York New York that was three times unintentionally so um all right so you um where did you stay each time oh so camping or what no I can't so I've done this lots of times I've done like big cycling trips lots of times and normally I do them in the summer and in the summer I camp because um I've done them in France um Italy and Corsica and you can be sure in all of those places that in the summer the weather will be hot and the days will be long um but in the spring that seemed like a bigger risk so I didn't camp um which is obviously good because it means you have to carry a tent so instead what I did was um it's like couch surfing you know Couchsurfing um but there's a Couchsurfing website that is especially for cyclists and it's called warm showers which is an odd name hmm um but it's not an odd website it's a good website video is still recording yeah yeah if we've been talking for one hour and 26 26 minutes we're very bad at being succinct don't we that's not what this podcast is about evidently Tick Tock is that's what Tick Tock no don't get me started yeah I'm really bad so um so you stayed warm showers I know I know okay and it's basically an app that allows you to meet up with other people and sleep on their couch and stuff yeah it's Couchsurfing but for cyclists okay and so I found from eight ninths on the road and well nine if you include the way back I found six people to host me and the other three nights I stayed in hotels um so it was great so I stayed um one time I stayed on a pig farm in the middle of nowhere in Germany that was great um another time I stayed in a tiny little wooden house on the edge of a forest um which was beautiful sounds like a could be scary also scary also because I had just watched stranger things I haven't seen stranger things there's a lot of monsters chasing people through a forest right so it was scary uh but also beautiful when you're in Germany as well so you're like fairy tales yeah is this where Hansel and Gretel nearly got eaten yeah and then I did follow a trail of breadcrumbs did you really yeah because I thought it might lead to some cake she didn't really I didn't that was a really bad joke as well it's all right um yes yeah so so I stayed in some great places and with lovely people and because they're also cyclists all of the people who host are cyclists they just know what you want which is a comfortable bed and a lot of food yeah and a warm shower hence the name right um yes okay so how many kilometers did you manage to do each day roughly depends on the day um the most I did was 130. okay and the least I think was about 85. all right then and uh you said very flat I mean you're going through where are we flat going through the Netherlands which is famously flat and yet the hilliest part was probably in the Netherlands really I went through the only hilly part of the Netherlands okay um but it's I don't know about in other languages but in French it's literally called the flat country yeah um so yeah and never in English means low doesn't it yeah it does yeah yeah so the Low Country the Low Country the low lands yeah okay so very flat but in fact I went through a slightly hilly part I mean it was very slight last summer I cycled around Corsica around the the edge of the island yeah that is not flat no it's one side of it's flat and the other side is very much not yeah so how do you how you didn't have to deal with many Hills this time so tell me about cycling up hills as a cyclist what I mean because like most people have probably had experience of cycling and those times when you're having to it's horrible and you think why am I doing this I just want this to stop yeah uh why do you why why why do you do this what's the the doctor it's about going up hills yeah going up hills is I don't think it's that difficult what's really difficult on a bike is when you have a headwind so that's a wind coming towards you that's slowing you down because the good thing about a hill is you know when it's going to end and when you're cycling into the wind it could just be like that for the entire day and you so you feel like you're making a lot of effort when you're cycling into the wind um but you're not getting anywhere very fast because the wind is against you and that's obviously that can be very powerful right so you can be working really hard and not really getting anywhere um and that's what is very um demoralizing and difficult but if you're cycling up a hill it feels like an achievement first of all whereas cycling Against the Wind not there's no sort of tangible sense of achievement there um and also you can see where it's going to end and you get the downhill afterwards yes which is glorious it's all downhill from from exactly once I once I cycled uphill I did a 14 kilometer uphill wow and it wasn't steep but it was uphill like steadily it was in the out at the edge of the Alps how long does that take oh I don't remember but it was a long time okay it's like a couple of hours yeah no more than an hour I think and that on that Hill I think I did stop to have something to eat like to have an energy bar or something but then the downhill was also 14 kilometers long wow and that's just amazing and how fast do you you do you go in in a situation like that it depends I did last summer I did Mount Von 2 which is the I see your French is really coming along it's actually wrong oh yeah of course why is it and then Vol 2 anyway never mind um Mountain Von 2 which is a famous mountain um in the Alps no it's in Provence okay oh it's at the top of Provence uh in the recluse um and it's very famous because it's often on the Tour de France and it's famously difficult even though it's not that high but it's called Von 2 because so Von in French means wind good work uh so you have been working on it um and it's very windy windy it's Mount windy yeah and the fastest wind speeds ever recorded on earth were recorded on the top of Mount Von too seriously I know but I didn't believe I'm not sure that's still the case but definitely for a long time it was the case I don't think it's been beaten is that only because like they're the only ones who had the recording equipment yeah there is always that isn't the wind recording equipment was invented on that yeah yeah but that was that was hard work yeah okay but then the speeds though that you and then going yeah that's why I started talking about it because I can't remember when I did that 14 kilometer up and 14 down I can't remember what speed I got to but I remember on Mount Von 2 last year going downhill getting to like I think it was 73 kilometers an hour um it's on a little dangerous terrifying terrifying yeah yeah and then we found out afterwards a few months later we found out that the bike I was on which was my mum's I'd borrowed I actually had a cracked frame so really shouldn't have been cycling it so I know that was quite scary okay side questioning I'm gonna ask you again I can ask you about the trip and stuff in a moment and continue with that side question have you ever had a crash on your bike yes I had one the biggest one I've ever had was this year on the 11th of March in Paris the infamous Infamous crash date I know that date so well because I've put it on so many medical forms now um because I was cycling along um it was like about quarter to eight in the morning on a Saturday I was going to work it's not a busy time on the roads and I was cycling down the boulevard the Sebastopol in the center of Paris normally very busy yes but not at that time in the morning and they've got a dedicated cycle Lane yeah so it's not too bad it's dedicated it's so keen on its job it loves it so um it was a dedicated cycle Lane and I was going down it and then you get to the who did at the bottom which is um quite again quite a busy road um but not at this time in the morning and somebody on a bicycle on a higher bike came zooming around the corner of the Rudy riverly into my side of the bike lane on the boulevard Sebastopol and smashed right into me and knocked me off whoa and there was a cake on the back of my bike this is the worst part yeah and the first thing I said was Manga too which means my cake um as the cake flew no the cake this is the brilliant thing the cake I'd attached it with bungees and it was in a plastic Tupperware that seals really really well yeah um and it was the perfect size for the cake the cake was fine completely fine the Kate on the other hand the Kate was not fine um I luckily was wearing a helmet which saved my life and really you wax your head on the floor smack my head on the pavement oh my god really hard wow um and got a concussion yeah and then I phoned work and nobody picked up because nobody would do because I never do also nobody was Staffing the phones before 8am yeah yeah true yeah um and then and then the guy who hit me was all like oh I'm sorry I'm sorry that was my fault and I was like correct it was your fault don't cycle like that um and then he got on his bike and cycled off oh okay leaving me on the floor with a concussion is that a crime it is a crime but I'm never gonna catch him am I yeah so that's that I've Just Let It Go um but then I got signed off work for eight days and I had to go for a brain scan and yeah it was quite a big deal was that an MRI scan yes how was that MRI scan that's when you have to lie down and they put you inside this horrible tube it was all right yeah all these weird noises around you the worst part was they said I needed an injection for the brain scan yeah so I got there and the guy looked the radiographer looked at my file and to check why I was there um and he said to me okay um you might not we might not need to give you the injection if you can stay really still and the images are clear enough we won't give you the injection and I hate injections so as I said before I'm going to be so good I'm not going to move at all so I was like Frozen in this machine um and then they did the scan and he came out again and said it's okay we don't need to give you the injection thank goodness because I would have hated that um but yes so I so that happened on a Saturday I continued on to work because I didn't know what else to do yeah and but I was cycling along you know crying yeah oh my God I'm really stressed out and it didn't what to do I think I I was okay until he cycled off and then it really upset me yeah because yeah because it's not a good thing to do that's a shitty thing it is really bad um so I yeah I was very upset um and then got to work and everyone was like um I don't think you can teach and I was like I'll be fine I'm just gonna go and teach now and they were all like no sit down we're going to take your lesson for you yeah um and then um I got a taxi I got sent home in a taxi did you have like symptoms um no it wasn't anything terrible I just um I had a very bad headache that didn't go away for a long time and I was struggling to kind of make full sentences and do anything quite important as an English teacher quite useful quite useful yeah but that was a Saturday um so I did see my doctor immediately and she um obviously gave me a medical note for that day because in France you have to get all your absences accounted for if you've got a medical problem which is fine so she gave me a note for that day and she said I'll put it down for tomorrow as well even though the next day was Sunday um and then I was due to go to work again on the Monday because it was an intensive week at work which is when we teach intensive courses all day every day all day every day when students come for a 30 hour course in one week um so those are my busy weeks obviously so I went into work on the Monday and it was like an out-of-body experience it was awful I mean why why because I felt like I was floating above my body and looking down on the classroom this is after two days two days yeah you came back after two years okay I thought I could come back and as I was the thing is the thing about something like concussion is when you're just having a quiet time at home you don't notice the symptoms because all I was doing was sitting reading I you know I went to the supermarket I had something Reading falling over you know exactly I didn't have to do anything mentally demanding you know I slept quite a lot um and then I went to work I cycled to work actually which was stupid of me um and as I was cycling to work everything was very heightened yeah meaning like all of the colors were brighter than usual was it the cake that you'd eaten it was not just the cake that I'd eaten that was the concussion right um concussion cake concussion cake um and then I got to work and I said to the head of the adult Department Andrea I was like I'm gonna go and teach but I don't think I can do it for very long and she said okay we'll keep me posted um and I yeah I went in and tried to teach and I don't think the students would have noticed anything terrible because um the first day of the course is quite it's pretty much always the same you basically give them a task where they're getting to know each other they're doing a lot of talking I don't have to do very much talking because the point is I'm listening to them taking notes giving Corrections that sort of thing and helping them to get to know each other because that's how the course is going to be a good course yeah if they bond and want to talk to each other yeah so it's quite formulaic the Monday morning so I I did it without too many issues um except for when they asked me questions sort of grammar questions and they've got vocabulary questions and I couldn't find my words yeah and then I came out of the class and I said I said I've got a brain scan book this afternoon and then I'm because I've already had it booked and and then I don't think I'm going to be back so I had the brain scan and then I was then I saw my doctor again it was a different doctor but at the same Hospital a doctor's surgery um who looked at my notes and said oh yeah you shouldn't have gone back to work and then signed me off for another week imagine if if Tina Turner had died that day as well I can't make full sentences and I have to hold on hold on people for support they would have been like and I've signed up for this course I'm joking of course but no a big lip but no that sounds that sounds horrible um yeah I mean I was very very lucky um thank goodness I was wearing a helmet um it literally saved my life that helmet and now I have to buy a new helmet because you're supposed to after a big impact you're supposed to buy a new one right and it was quite new and very expensive that rotter who crashed into you I know I have to buy another one um which I haven't got around to doing yet which was a bit naughty of me I will do it well thank goodness you're wearing a helmet yeah wear a helmet kids really do wear a helmet really really do and I used to almost always wear a helmet but if I was doing a short trip you know to a friend's house or the supermarket or something like that or a trip where I was just cycling next to the canal for example there are no Cars I often wouldn't put my helmet on because it's a five minute cycle or whatever now I always do every single time yeah because all it takes is some Nutter on a on a rental bike who doesn't give a crap they're very big those rentals they're very big electric ones was it the was it the white and green ones yeah yes yeah they're really heavy very heavy I mean he fell off as well yeah he got back on it and as he got back on I said you can't just cycle off and leave me and he was like oh yeah yeah but yes I can well then I turned around to look at my bike um I'd broken a few spokes on the front wheel I had to replace them but um I turned around to look at my bike and to pick it up again to try and start picking it up and then when I turned back he'd gone when your back was turned my back was turned cowardly that's exactly what happened yeah you turned your back and he just disappeared what an absolute  yeah it wasn't a great day no but then it was okay you know I was I wasn't too bad I I just I think I think I'm very we're very lucky to live in a country where we have very good health care and we get signed off we need to be signed off and that's that then you're you're paid properly and you know your need for rest is recognized and and there you go absolutely wow wow I didn't expect the full the full uh sorry okay uh concussion story but no no I didn't mean another two-hour episode isn't it yeah well you know what okay um the the episode I did before this one which is just me on my own guess how long that one oh no ended up being three hours three hours of you talking to yourself me talking to myself not only I could talk to myself for that long can we put the video back I can't see it anymore yeah yeah yeah yeah can we just do this yeah no you gotta you gotta I'm gonna have to unlock You've Been So Young in that picture does that have a beard so when my when my listeners when my computer falls asleep and it has to be woken up again that you see a picture of me and I have to enter my password and the picture of me is me without a beard and I I do look younger without a beard yeah so do I yeah yeah um so all right uh what about your can we pause can I just say can we have another cupcake yeah yeah of course if we have it will you have half yeah definitely I was going to ask you about the rest of the trip to Berlin were there any uh any I mean it's okay so you got back on your bike after that which happened that happened in March did it uh that happened in March um and then you did your trip um in in April May end of April beginning of May yeah yeah okay so all right you weren't deterred by your your traumatic experience no no and you in fact you decided to to double down on the cycling and and do really long distance yeah what were the roads like that you were I know it's flat but you were riding through Germany I imagine Germany going long distances I think Autobahn people driving BMW is incredibly fast I didn't go on the auto part no no no obviously because it wasn't an auto it was a Farhad it's really hard to pronounce my first can I tell you about my first proper conversation in german yes so I started studying German in um February maybe after some after I got invited on this trip I was like I better learn some German yeah so I started studying and um thank you hold on Kate how are we going to manage the uh the the consumption of the cake you go for us and I'll tell you carry on with your anecdote I'm going to mute my microphone in three two one I wonder at which point the Poo cut out I didn't hear the Pew yeah and see I don't know if you can hear him um I was just saying that so I started learning German um to be able to obviously sort of navigate my way a little bit more easily around Germany and um my first proper conversation in German was as I was cycling around the edge of Dusseldorf which I'm probably pronouncing wrong I'm sorry German speakers and um I was going over this bridge and I wanted to take a photo of the view of the city I didn't go into this a little it looked very nice from the outside um and so I stopped on this bridge and I have a bicycle where you clip into the pedals you wear special shoes that clip to the pedals um because it makes you more efficient when you're pedaling um so I had to unclip so I stopped on this on this uh bridge and I unclipped one foot and sort of put it to the side and a family was walking past me um a mum and dad and a little girl and the girl watched me do this she was about six years old maybe and then she said which means cool bicycle um and I was like oh my goodness I understood her so it was very cool I was very happy um and I said danker which means thank you and then I took my photo and got back on my bike and cycled past them again and then I waved at them and said juice which means goodbye um and it was just it was obviously not an in-depth conversation but it was just very pleasing to have this like fully genuine interaction in a language that I'd only been learning for about three months by that point I think and it was and I it was one thing that was nice about it was they from that conversation probably don't know that I don't really speak German as well I felt like I tricked them that they maybe think my German's okay it's not good you did it you kind of checked the boxes of a successful interaction in another very successful which is where you like say the right things at the right time and that you both leave the other person goes away not knowing that your relatives yeah no idea it was great yeah well done yeah it was really nice um it's a cool bicycle yeah um what kind of bicycle is it it's a Touring bike yeah um which is it's similar to a road bike in that the tires are quite thin um but um it's the tires are thicker than on a normal road bike so you can go for example if you have a track with a bit of gravel on it or something you can go on that and they're also um heavier than road bikes so you can put a lot of luggage on them they've got a rack on the back on the back mud guards yeah you can put a rack on the front as well if you want to yeah okay um yeah they can carry a lot of weight handlebars yes they have handlebars yes good what not a unicycle what kind of handlebars drop handlebars drop handlebars yeah meaning meaning that they they go out straight and then they drop down either side they sort of drop down and forwards yes you're going to lean forward do you have those cool brakes where the brake handles you can with those drop handlebars you can hold them on the sort of horizontal part or you can lean forwards like Batman in um The Dark Knight I do look like Batman you kind of go into that forward position yeah and you've got like trigger style brakes on the front as well I've only got them on they're on the side so if you're standing up holding the top part if you're kind of climbing up a hill can't break you can't break no okay all right you've got to get used to it it's quite it's also a very very big bike because I'm quite a tall person um and it was made for me I won't really yeah I went to the shop it's called Thorne they're a very very good bike manufacturer based in the UK and the frames are made in I'm pretty sure it's Taiwan um and you go there and they take all your measurements and then the frame is made for you so because I'm quite tall it's a very big bag it was my 21st birthday present for my parents who are very keen cyclists yeah two of my parents are my my mum and my step dad only two of you I've got four you've got four parents yeah which is honestly greedy but they're all great so that's nice yeah um okay fantastic all right what's the what's the best part of the trip um was it that moment that moment was really lovely where a girl said wow cool bicycle what was it again because it sounds almost like she's going cool as how old is this he was about six years ago I mean look she has a cool as bicycle I would love that um some Germans roll their eyes a little bit okay I think it depends where you're from in German maybe they I don't know this is my attempt to say it yeah far loud it's hard it's f-a-h-r-r-dink yeah but um uh they'll be German listeners you can jump into the comments section guys and uh help your sermons please forgive my my pitiful attempts to speak your language it's a beautiful language I absolutely love German yeah yeah me too um do you speak German nine uh no I don't evidence no I really don't I don't but I like hearing it I like it when I hear people speak in German yeah it's great I love all the languages I love hearing people speaking them in uh you know when I hear people just overhear people in conversations and just like yeah listen to it and think which language is that wow this is all those different sounds like I was hearing someone speaking Arabic the other day in a shop where I was taking a package back into the shop and there were just a couple of people chatting in Arabic and it's like wow that's awesome um so the the your journey did it take longer or less time than this episode of the podcast oh definitely less time really yeah for sure all right yeah okay I listened to a podcast as I was cycling yeah what did you listen to um it's a podcast to learn German it's called coffee break German oh yeah yeah yeah you know coffee break I do know the coffee break series every time I look at a the the lists of the top podcasts in the language learning category they're always at the top of the list coffee break German coffee break French coffee break Italian the men's Luke's English podcast down somewhere further down the list no they're very good they're very good for getting you from beginner or in my case nothing up to some understanding so they're very good at getting you from Paris to Berlin yes on a bicycle yeah there's another one um uh uh Alf Deutsche sucked do you know what that means apparently it means German as it's spoken um I think or spoken German but it's a podcast listener one of my listeners does that podcast it's for higher level uh German speakers though so if you get to um guess that gets hacked yes okay I'm probably pronouncing it wrong uh but yeah when you get to that B1 B2 level then you can start listening to ALF deutschicken I look forward to it I'm going to continue studying German it's great yeah yeah you really like it yeah and I think in in uh Robin's podcast that's the name of the host he does uh sort of you know conversational stuff it's not just instructional stuff so if you want to listen to It's probably something similar to Luke's English podcast but I'm I'm almost 100 certain that it's shorter and more efficient it will be more efficient yes very which is not hard is it we've set a low bar for that depends depends what people are looking for if they're looking for rambling conversations where we go from A to B to G to to n and throw a few jokes in between then you know this that's what they that's what they get isn't it with this and a cake if they want to hear someone eating a cake or Not Here someone eating a cake yeah mute me and talk for a bit I didn't I didn't mute you you've been eating a bit of cake and I didn't mute you but no one noticed did you know did you hear that listeners you didn't did you can you meet me now so I can eat some more please Kate will be muted in three two one okay so listeners what else shall I ask Kate I did actually write some things down we've got to stop this at some point because otherwise I mean do we should we yeah I have to go to work you do what you oh really what about your lunch you can eat during the meeting oh really everyone's gonna be okay with that mute myself um okay so my question's like what kind of bike do you have you've answered that how did you get into cycling um okay your parents your parents are Keen cyclists have you ever done a jump on your bike have you ever done a jump on your bike no she's shaking her head no have you have you ever done it I'm not 12 Luke I know have you ever done a skid on your bike doing a skid listeners that's when you pull the brakes and that maybe one of the tires slides along the floor something you do when you're 12 you think it's really cool I've done that by accident while it's snowing all right snow is the worst condition in which just to to try and ride a bike I thought drunk would be the worst condition sorry snowing is the worst weather condition also it's snowing and also icy roads snowing when you're cycling when you're drunk and it's snowing and it's snowing yeah that is a real recipe for disaster yeah have you ever had a crash you answered that have you ever gone over the handlebars no luckily yeah okay a lot of people who have how about this question Kate if you haven't ridden a bike for quite a long time and then you do it again is it easy to remember how to do it Kate's still eating her cupcake yes it's like riding a bike yay obviously I set that one up do we need to explain that go on there's something like riding a bike that's exactly what it means the thing that Lucas just said it means once you've learned it you never forget it yeah so for example I've been away on holiday or you know for for a few weeks I've been off work and I come back and it's like oh God you know a bit Rusty I haven't been haven't taught for a while and Kate says oh don't worry it's just like riding a bike you'll get straight back into it yep yeah okay meaning something that's something you haven't done for a while but you could do it easily you'll never forget how to do it it's like riding a bike yes yeah yeah yeah um okay I think it's probably a good do you think we've talked enough I think we've probably done enough oh goodness man how much is too much um it's all really it's a piece of string it's yeah exactly how long is a piece of string uh well I guess the listeners can can conclude that uh they got you know an extra uh two hours for nothing you know it's always free isn't it yeah unless they are paid subscribers who get their premium content and the and no and no adverts because in some regions the episodes will be interrupted at the can you interrupt something at the start I don't know but in some regions there's an adverse preceded by an advert yeah there can be a little advert at the beginning and there's often one in the middle that will interrupt proceedings and then one at the end but if you're a paid subscriber to Luke's English podcast premium then you don't get uh any of those interruptions and you also don't get yeah and you get access to all the premium episodes as well of course what's in the premium episodes what am I missing out teach stuff there's stories oh nice yeah I've been doing a series lately called Story Time very very original um time did you come up with it it's time for a story story time um and uh to tell stories about things that have happened to me in my life for example I've never I haven't done a bike crash story but I could maybe if I could just think of a time when I fell off a bike make that into a story I did I've done some some episodes where I tell the story and then I teach some vocab from the story then I provide them with little grammar exercises using the story um pronunciation practice where they've they can listen repeat after me um all available at teacherloop.co.uk premium that's good isn't it hmm do you have a little tip there so what percentage of the of what you put out would you say is premium um in terms of like behind the premium paywall yeah um so I tend to do a premium series uh something like every four episodes so there might be four episodes of the the free podcast to be fair I probably do too much free and I should probably be making people pay for more of it but just it's just the way I do it but I'll do pretty much an episode every week of the of the free show right and that's just uninterrupted most of the time unless I you know unfortunately okay maybe yeah or let's in this case yeah perhaps but I mean uninterrupted in the sense that they come every week oh sorry uh but also an interrupted like when you press play that's it you know um it's the stream of Consciousness just talking and then um and then uh every month I'll upload a premium series and that would be normally two or maybe more episodes the first one is where I'm telling the story and teaching some stuff the second one is pronunciation practice uh also do different types of Premium episode there's language review ones where I go through conversations I've had on the podcast pull out bits of language that has that has come up and then have a list and I explain talk about it and demonstrate it and highlight little things and then do pronunciation practice that sometimes those are quite long series because if I have 20 items of vocab I cover the first 10 in the first episode then pronunciation practice then the next ten then more pronunciation practice that's four episodes sometimes I will just talk uh you know ramble like this and then afterwards go through lots of lots of the vocab and expressions that came up naturally and then do pronunciation practice um sometimes do a kind of a deep dive into an area of grammar oh I love a deep drive 12 part series on present perfect of course you did the present perfect is the reason that we have jobs yeah it is thank God for the present person and that and phrasal verbs keeping us all in employment keeping us all in employment yeah yeah keeping English Learners everywhere in a Perpetual state of frustration but we have jobs it's like dentists like uh like in the sense that they're glad that we have teeth that yeah thank goodness teeth exists I mean thank goodness that dentists that uh the the uh the irony of being a dentist that you're there to try and help people with their oral health but if everyone's teeth were fine then they would be out of a job so I'm not saying that dentists are also um uh causing the tooth problems no there's not some conspiracy theory about dentists uh what am I talking about I don't know I don't know I've got no idea why I said it's like dentists I had an idea in my mind but now I can't verbalize it fair enough anyway everyone there yeah we've all been there um Kate Billington thank you very much for coming back onto my podcast Luke Thompson with a p thank you very much for having me yeah yeah yeah it's been lots of fun thank you so much for bringing cake it was

              "[\"hello welcome back to the podcast all right how are you doing I hope you're doing fine in podcast land in lepland I hope you're having a nice morning afternoon evening night whatever time of day it is wherever you are hello welcome Kate Billington is back on the podcast again in this episode uh Kate is a popular guest this is her fourth appearance on the show just in case you don't know or in case you've forgotten Kate is an English teacher like me we work together in the same school she also does stand-up comedy in the evenings sometimes like me Kate also makes cakes she's a professionally qualified cake maker she makes Cakes and Pastries and Kate loves cycling and in fact this episode is called Kate Billington cycled to Berlin so here is about two hours of Kate and me in conversation natural conversation conversation that flows this way and that way as it moves forward so yeah two hours it's another long episode and so with this I just invite you to join us try to follow the conversation see what bits of English you can pick up along the way you don't have to listen to the whole thing in one go obviously you can if you want to just join us for the whole two hours but you don't have to listen to it all in one go you can listen to some and then stop and then later you can listen to some more uh the you know the more you listen the more you learn but it's up to you if you feel like after half an hour that's enough for you if you feel like you wanted a half an hour episode listen to half an hour of this but otherwise if you're enjoying it and you you are captivated keep going because the more you listen the more you learn hopefully um we will keep this fairly entertaining and enjoyable for you all the way through with some jokes some little stories and some little explanations of vocabulary or expressions or little cultural details um consider listening to the audio version on your phone you know what a phone is right consider listening to the audio version which you can just get in a podcast app on your phone I use pocket casts but you could use apple podcasts Google podcast Spotify you could listen to the audio version just subscribe to Luke's English podcast in your podcast app of choice and the advantage of that is that you can do other things while you listen just put your headphones on and uh you just do other things while you're listening which allows you to multitask like you could do some housework you could drive you could walk around somewhere just walk around in a circle uh or or alternatively walk to a specific place if you've got some shopping to do or something uh while you're spending time on public transport on the way to work and on the way back or whatever it is you're doing this is how most people listen to podcasts they just listen to the audio version allowing which allows you to do other things at the same time that's another way to do it alternatively you could just close your eyes and just focus on the words phrases and sentences that you can hear but don't do that while driving a car or operating heavy machinery or any of those other dangerous things um but there you go anytime you want to stop you can just pause the episode and all podcast apps will remember where you paused so that when you come back to the episode you'll be able to continue from that moment and then carry on and ultimately I think it's probably best not to think about the length of the episode okay don't see this as a mountain that you have to climb the length it doesn't really matter just join us get involved in our conversation keep listening enjoy it and get carried away by the sounds of the English language in Motion One Last Thing Before we start properly this episode is called Kate Billington cycled to Berlin and that was the original plan for this episode to talk about her long cycling adventure to Berlin cycling all the way to the to that City but in the typical way here on Luke's English podcast there were plenty of tangents distractions and other talking points along the way to that main topic and you'll see me trying to get there but for some reason we end up talking about this that and the other which is fine that's the whole Spirit of this show um so we do eventually talk about Kate's cycling trip and there's also a story about a nice a nice no that's not the word definitely not the right word not nice nasty there's a story of a very nasty cycling accident that Kate had recently which will definitely hold your attention so we do talk about those things about the cycling but it takes us a while to get there uh when do we when exactly do we start talking about the cycling trip and the cycling accident well you'll have to wait and see but keep listening because we do get there eventually so now without any further Ado let's now join my conversation with Kate and we jump straight in with me attempting to start the recording of the video and audio tracks while also making tea and talking to Kate all at the same time it's exactly the same way that uh the last episode with Kate started uh so more of the same kind of stuff more conversation with Kate all right so\"]"
